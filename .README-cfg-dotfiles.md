# Instructions for using my dotfiles

I'm attempting to make a dotfiles setup using [Nicola Paolucci's](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)

I have changed my alias to "dotconfig" instead of "config" and my bare directory to ".cfg-dotfiles"

There is an install script on BitBucket that should be accessible with  
`curl -Lks https://goo.gl/AjMPP3 | /bin/bash`  

The above script should install Homebrew, Git, and then download and install my .cfg-dotfiles repo

Then follow the set-up order in this gist  

# Reinstall plan based on [Nicola Paolucci's](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) dotfiles

- [ ] 1) Boot from recovery mode
  - hold down Cmd + R while restarting
- [ ] 2) wipe the drive by selecting Disk Utility
- [ ] 3) reinstall OS


## Install My .cfg-dotfiles
- `curl -Lks https://goo.gl/AjMPP3 | /bin/bash`  
This will put my .zshrc, .gitconfig, and Brewfile in a .cfg-dotfiles repo.  
May need to move files to home directory or hopefully will show up.  


## [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
- `brew install git`  
I've attempted to include these 2 commands in the install script below so try running it first.  


## Install Oh-My-Zsh
- `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
- follow instructions on [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) to make `zsh` the default
- edit `.zshrc` and set default theme to `amuse` or hopefully install from saved dotfiles ;)  


### [Checking for and Installing ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- `zsh --version` to confirm. Expected result: `zsh 4.3.9` or more recent
- `echo $SHELL` from a new terminal to confirm expected result: `/bin/zsh` or similar
- `chsh -s $(which zsh)` make it the default shell
- Log out and login back again to use your new default shell.
- `echo $SHELL` expected result: `/bin/zsh` or similar.  

If ZSH is not installed then proceed to install Homebrew then come back an install using
- `brew install zsh zsh-completions` to install and add zsh-completions
- `zsh --version` If it's newer than 4.3.9 you might be OK. Preferably newer than or equal to 5.0.


## Get Powerline fonts for `Cousine for Powerline`
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
  cd fonts
  ./install.sh
  cd ..
  rm -rf fonts
  ```
(comments are fine)  


## Generate a New SSH Key
  - [generate new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) with that link or this [video by DevMarketer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5qNpRGB7Qw)
    - `ls -al ~/.ssh` to check for existing ssh keys. If no `id-rsa` or `id-rsa.pub` files are present then proceed.
    - `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "calebsanderson@gmail.com"` will generate new keys.
      - `-t` is type of `rsa`
      - `-b` is for bytes = 4096 and is specific
      - `-C` is for email
    - on following file location prompt just press enter to leave it in default folder
    - enter passphrase (same as computer login)
    - will generate the keys (public and private) in own files and show random art.
    - `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
    - `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
    - follow with passsword (the same as computer login)
  - go to **GitHub > settings > SSH and GPG keys** and delete old SSH key and click on "New SSH Key" button.
  - back in terminal run `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` which will copy the contents of the public key
    - (didn't work for me so I opened the file and copied the contents of the file manually)
  - back in GitHub paste into the key field and save in GitHub - will ask to re-enter GH password (from 1Password)


## Installing with Brew-cask
Hopefully these will install with Brewfile. If not, run them individually


## Atom
- install `sync-settings` package, login with 1password, download and update all packages
  - install `glist` and login with the access token from 1password under "Glist Personal - Atom Package"


## Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md)
  - install with `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash`
  - config with  

```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```  

```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```  

which does some setup stuff

- Install Node `nvm install node` which also sets up npm.
- verify install with `command -v nvm` which should output 'nvm'


## Install these via NPM
- Trash CLI command with `npm install --global trash-cli`
- nodemon with `npm install -g nodemon`


## Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
- `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
- In case of problems: https://rvm.io/help
- `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm` loads rvm
- test with `type rvm | head -n 1` which should output `rvm is a function`
- `rvm list known` shows all available versions of ruby
- install ruby version with e.g. `rvm install 2.1`
- `rvm use 2.1` uses that version of ruby
- `which ruby` shows folder where versions are stored


## Install from Web
