# Using My Dotfiles

The general idea for my dotfiles setup comes from [Nicola Paolucci's](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) post about his method, which is of course built on someone else's. Nicola uses Bitbucket, but I am using shell scripts in priveat Github gists and then making Google shortened urls out of the link to the raw file. The scripts are meant to be installed in order or independently as needed. Each script ends with an `echo` that contains instructions on the next script to `curl` so you can follow the breadcrumbs by copying, pasteing, and running them in succession or come to this repo and cherry-pick the ones you need. These scripts contain my personal preferences so check out the urls for yourself to make sure it is what you want.

Nicola's implementation works great but I changed my git alias to "dotconfig" instead of Nicola's "config" and my bare directory to ".cfg-dotfiles" instead of just ".cfg".

The general order of operations is...  


## make the "dotconfig" alias get everything started
- `curl -Lks http://bit.do/cfsanderson-dotfiles`
  - to see stats on this link visit `http://bit.do/cfsanderson-dotfiles-`


## Install My [.cfg-dotfiles](https://github.com/cfsanderson/cfg-dotfiles)
- `curl -Lks https://goo.gl/7xGC2L | /bin/bash`
 Â - this starts the process and from here you should be able to copy/paste the `===== curl -Lks <shortened url> | bash =====` command at the end of each script for a full, fresh install.


## [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- https://goo.gl/5LyA5C
  - `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
  - `brew bundle` should install all dependencies from Brewfile
    - see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle for more info  


## [Checking for ZSH and make the default shell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- https://goo.gl/fnswYk
- `zsh --version` to confirm. Expected result: `zsh 4.3.9` or more recent
- `echo $SHELL` from a new terminal to confirm expected result: `/bin/zsh` or similar
- `chsh -s $(which zsh)` make it the default shell
- Log out and login back again to use your new default shell.
- `echo $SHELL` expected result: `/bin/zsh` or similar.  
  - TODO - this could probably be cleaned up or combined as with the next script.

## Install Oh-My-Zsh
- https://goo.gl/rysF9G
  - `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
  - This may move existing .zshrc file to .zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh. Simply rename the files and resource the terminal to load from preferred .zshrc  


## Get Powerline fonts for `Cousine for Powerline`

## Install [NVM](https://gist.github.com/cfsanderson/32bc37416c1373c5314d9ea98146fa7c) from script  
- https://goo.gl/PKx3eV  


## Install [NPM dependencies](https://gist.github.com/cfsanderson/087f5fd991a7b8edff0bcc5e451e2fef) from script  
- https://goo.gl/VkzXbb  


## Install [RVM](https://gist.github.com/cfsanderson/b4aad70c323058c309d2da5b0e2ffb70) from script  
- https://goo.gl/P473b2
  - RVM wasn't working right so I added `rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles` per the message instructions and now it is working fine.
  - TODO - change install script to add `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby` to first line.


## Generate a New SSH Key (https://goo.gl/gWKCSX)
  - [generate new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) with that link or this [video by DevMarketer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5qNpRGB7Qw)
    - `ls -al ~/.ssh` to check for existing ssh keys. If no `id-rsa` or `id-rsa.pub` files are present then proceed.
    - `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "calebsanderson@gmail.com"` will generate new keys.
      - `-t` is type of `rsa`
      - `-b` is for bytes = 4096 and is specific
      - `-C` is for email
    - on following file location prompt just press enter to leave it in default folder
    - enter passphrase (same as computer login)
    - will generate the keys (public and private) in own files and show random art.
    - `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
    - `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
    - follow with password (the same as computer login)
  - go to **GitHub > settings > SSH and GPG keys** and delete old SSH key and click on "New SSH Key" button.
  - back in terminal run `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` which will copy the contents of the public key
    - (didn't work for me so I opened the file and copied the contents of the file manually)
  - back in GitHub paste into the key field and save in GitHub - will ask to re-enter GH password (from 1Password)  



## Atom
- [ ] install `sync-settings` package
- use credentials from 1password to login, download, and update all packages
- in settings of `glist` package, paste github access token from 1password under "Glist - Atom Package"

## TODOs
- [ ] Make a "Screenshots" folder in Google Drive and change default location for screenshots to that directory
  - [ ] `mkdir Google\ Drive/Screenshots`
  - [ ] `defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/caleb/Google\ Drive/Screenshots`
  - [ ] `killall SystemUIServer`
- [ ] Update gist urls using this pattern for linking to latest version.
