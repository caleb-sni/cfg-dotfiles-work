These install scripts are daisy-chained together using `bit.do` shortened urls. They are meant to be run in succession starting with the `xcode-install-script` which is generally the first thing in a fresh install on a new machine. Although they can be run consecutively, some are useful as stand alone install scripts. All of the following urls are short links back to the these raw files so that they can be installed using the `curl -Lks <url> | bash` command. from any bash shell. Below is an ordered list of the urls and a brief description of what they accomplish.
